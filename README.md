Yes, I know it's dumb and the code is bad. Feel free to change it yourself.<br>
This application can be built cross-platform using any c++ ide. I did not include CMake files because I hate CMake and it is stupid. >:(

The release folder contains a working win32 executable, but you could build it yourself for any other platform. (Thanks to SFML.)
